## Reflection

- This interesting project was built for a technical interview, and test my knowledge about some tools.

- This project was a good learning experience because I was able to test my knowledge and improve some things that were not requirements.

- About obstacles, I think it was the tests, test are something I have to improve and develop my knowledge.

- In this project, I use React, Redux, TypeScript, SASS, Axios, Jest, Testing-Library.
